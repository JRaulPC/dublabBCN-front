# Description üìñ


This repository contains the front end of the online community radio Dublab Barcelona, enabling users to listen to live radio and recorded shows streamed on the radio.
It integrates two APIs to display real-time data: one specifically built for the project using Django, which stores all recorded show data, and the Airtime API.
Airtime is a CMS used to manage online radios. In summary, this application is responsible for connecting the data contained in these two APIs and facilitating access to live radio streams.
